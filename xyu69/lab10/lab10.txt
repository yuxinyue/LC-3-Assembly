QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab10.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab10.bin.)

ANSWER: 
R2 will be motified, and it will contain decimal munber 12 (01100).

QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: 
If we run the entire code and don't get the result expected, we cannot tell what is going wrong.
By stepping through a program, we could see if each instruction works as we expected. So we could exam our code line by line to find bugs.
